#Pig Latin sentence
'''
Write a function
called pl_sentence that takes a string containing several words, separated by
spaces. (To make things easier, we wonâ€™t actually ask for a real sentence. More specifically,
there will be no capital letters or punctuation.)
So, if someone were to call
    pl_sentence('this is a test translation')
the output would be
    histay isway away estay ranslationtay
Print the output on a single line, rather than with each word on a separate line.

#Beyond the exercise 1 (BTE_1)
'''
Take a text file, creating (and printing) a nonsensical sentence from the nth
word on each of the first 10 lines, where n is the line number.

    word7 word8 word9
